            These are all array methods that are used to perform various
            operations on arrays. <br />
            <strong>map():</strong> This method takes a function as a parameter
            and applies it to the original array and returns a new array. The
            function takes each element as input and returns a new value, which
            is added to the new array. This method does not change the original
            array.<br />
            <strong>forEach():</strong> This method applies a function to each
            element in the array but does not return anything. This method is
            useful for performing some action on each element in the array.
            <br />
            <strong>filter(): </strong>This method takes a callback function as
            a parameter, returns a new array and containing only the elements
            that pass the specified by a function. <br />
            <strong>find(): </strong>This method takes a callback function as a
            parameter, and returns only the first elements that pass the
            specified by a function. The function is applied to each element in
            the array until an element is found that returns a true value.

            These are all ways to store data in a user's browser, but there are
            some key differences between them.<br />
            <strong>Cookies: </strong>Cookies are small text files that are
            stored in a user's browser by a website. They are used for
            authentication and tracking purposes and make it easier to visit the
            site again and make the site more useful. Cookies are sent to the
            server with each request. Cookies are limited to about 4KB of data.
            <br />
            <strong>Local Storage: </strong>The local storage is another way to
            store data in a user's browser. Local storage stores data with no
            expiration date. The data is not deleted when the browser is closed,
            and are available for future sessions. Local storage can be used to
            store larger amounts of data than cookies (up to 5-10MB), and it can
            be accessed using JavaScript. Data stored in local storage is not
            sent to the server. Local storage stored data to specific website
            domain that can not accessed to another website. <br />
            <strong>Session Storage: </strong>Session storage is similar to
            local storage. Session storage stores data for only one session. The
            data is deleted when the browser is closed. Session storage can be
            used to store larger amounts of data than cookies (up to 5-10MB),
            and it can be accessed using JavaScript. Data stored in session
            storage is not sent to the server. Session storage stored data to
            specific website domain that can not accessed to another website.

            Q.3-What is an
            <span class="font-semibold">event loop</span> and how does it work?

          <h4 class="text-zinc-800 text-lg text-justify border-b mb-4">

            <strong>Event Loop: </strong>The event loop is a core component of
            the JavaScript runtime engine. Which performs various types of
            asynchronous tasks. Event loop works on first in first out (FIFO)
            principle that means the event loop continuously checks the message
            queue for any new messages or events, and processes them one at a
            time. <br />
            <span class="underline">Here's how the event loop works:</span>
            <br />
            JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it can only do
            one thing at a time. <br />
            To handle these long-running tasks without blocking the main thread,
            JavaScript uses asynchronous functions and callbacks. <br />
            Asynchronous tasks are executed on separate threads or processes,
            and their associated callbacks are added to the message queue once
            they've completed. This allows JavaScript to handle long-running
            tasks without blocking the main thread, and to continue executing
            other code while waiting for asynchronous tasks to complete.
